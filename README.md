# CCCP-Registry

The registry is part of the delivery of the **CentOS Community Container Pipeline**. The aim of the pipeline is to take container artifacts on one end, build the container, test and verify it, and then release it for public use.

The registry will contain the final built images, distributed over a CDN setup. 

You can read more about the pipeline [here](https://github.com/kbsingh/cccp-index).
